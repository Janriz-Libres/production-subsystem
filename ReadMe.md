## Features & Limitations
- The initial resources are provided by the user
- Products are fixed but can be changed by modifying the "products" variable in the Main.java file
- Required resources for each product are randomized
- A visualization of the entire process is dynamically printed on the command prompt from top to bottom
- There are no input constraints so it is assumed that the user enters an integer when the program asks for a number
